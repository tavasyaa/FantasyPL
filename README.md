# FantasyPL

### Python, using Matplotlib and Pandas

I'm an avid fan of the English Premier League, and every year I play Fantasy Premier League with my friends, who all put in a set amount of money in a pot for the winner to grab.

Hopefully this ups my chances of winning some money from my friends :)

1. First, I analyze my team's performance by comparing points/gameweek to the FPL average. 
2. I delve into players' points, points/minute, points/game, points/$, and minutes values to see if I can uncover any hidden gems.
